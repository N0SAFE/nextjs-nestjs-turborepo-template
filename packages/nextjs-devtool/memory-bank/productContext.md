# Product Context - NextJS DevTool

## Purpose & Problems Solved

### Developer Pain Points
- **Debugging Complexity**: Hard to inspect application state, routes, and build artifacts during development
- **Context Switching**: Constantly switching between dev tools, logs, and application
- **Type Safety Gap**: Lack of type-safe communication between dev tool components
- **Plugin Management**: No unified system for development utilities and extensions

### Solution Vision
A unified, type-safe development tool that provides:
- **Centralized Development Hub**: All dev utilities in one place
- **Type-Safe Plugin System**: Contract-first plugins with full TypeScript support
- **Flexible UI Modes**: Compact bar for quick access, expanded panel for detailed work
- **Real-time Insights**: Live application data, routes, logs, and cache inspection

## User Experience Goals

### Primary User: Next.js Developers
**Workflow Integration:**
1. **Quick Status Check**: Glance at reduced bar for critical info (errors, cache status, build info)
2. **Deep Inspection**: Expand to full panel for detailed debugging and exploration
3. **Plugin Management**: Easy activation/deactivation of development tools
4. **Type-Safe Development**: Intellisense-driven interaction with all plugin APIs

### Use Cases

#### 1. Development Debugging
- **Route Inspection**: View all application routes with metadata
- **Build Analysis**: Check bundle info, assets, and build-time data
- **Log Monitoring**: Real-time log viewing and filtering
- **Cache Inspection**: TanStack Query cache state and invalidation

#### 2. Authentication Development
- **Session Management**: View current user session, roles, permissions
- **User Operations**: Quick user listing and management during development
- **Auth Flow Testing**: Easy session invalidation and testing

#### 3. Task Management
- **Development TODOs**: Track development tasks within the tool
- **Feature Flags**: Toggle development features and configurations
- **Quick Actions**: Rapid access to common development operations

## Value Propositions

### For Individual Developers
- **Productivity Boost**: Reduce context switching and tool juggling
- **Type Safety**: Prevent runtime errors with compile-time checking
- **Customization**: Tailor the tool with relevant plugins for your workflow
- **Learning Aid**: Explore application internals through guided interfaces

### For Development Teams
- **Consistency**: Shared development tool configuration across team
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Plugin system allows team-specific utilities
- **Debugging Collaboration**: Shared mental model of application state
- **Onboarding**: New developers get powerful introspection tools immediately

### For Project Maintainers
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture allows custom development utilities
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Next.js applications
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and selective imports minimize impact
- **Standards**: Contract-first approach enforces API consistency

## Experience Principles

### 1. Non-Intrusive
- **Production Safety**: Completely disabled in production builds
- **Optional Usage**: Tool presence doesn't affect application functionality
- **Flexible Positioning**: Dock anywhere on screen without blocking UI

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- **Reduced Mode**: Essential info always visible
- **Expanded Mode**: Full functionality when needed
- **Context-Aware**: Show relevant information for current application state

### 3. Type-First Development
- **Contract Definition**: Every plugin defines its API contract upfront
- **Typed Interactions**: All plugin communications are type-checked
- **IntelliSense Support**: Full autocomplete and documentation in IDE

### 4. Performance Conscious
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load plugin code when actually used
- **Selective Imports**: Import only server OR client OR hooks as needed
- **Minimal Footprint**: Tool overhead should be negligible in development
