# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### NextJS DevTool UI Redesign (LATEST)
**COMPLETED:** Major UI overhaul to match modern devtool design patterns from Nuxt DevTools and Laravel Debugbar.

**Implementation Summary:**
- âœ… **Expanded Mode:** Transformed to Nuxt DevTools-style bottom-center card
  - Card positioning: `fixed bottom-4 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2`
  - Modern styling: `rounded-xl shadow-2xl backdrop-blur-sm bg-opacity-95`
  - Responsive sizing: `w-[90vw] max-w-6xl h-[32rem]`
  - Shadcn sidebar integration maintained

- âœ… **Reduced Mode:** Redesigned to Laravel Debugbar-style horizontal bar
  - Full-width bottom positioning: `fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0`
  - Horizontal plugin tabs with status indicators
  - Laravel-style active/inactive states with colored dots
  - Right-side controls: logo, expand button, settings

### NextJS DevTool Development (Core)
Building a comprehensive development tool for Next.js applications with plugin architecture and ORPC integration.

**Current Phase:** UI polish and plugin ecosystem expansion
- âœ… Basic plugin system with plugin manager
- âœ… **NEW:** Modern DevTool UI inspired by Nuxt DevTools + Laravel Debugbar
- âœ… ORPC integration with type-safe API communication
- âœ… Shadcn UI component integration with new card-style layout
- ðŸ”„ **ACTIVE:** Plugin ecosystem expansion with improved UX

## Recent Changes

### Major UI Redesign (Latest Session)
**Context:** User requested mixed design approach combining Nuxt DevTools (expanded) with Laravel Debugbar (reduced)

**Changes Made:**
1. **DevToolExpandedPanel.tsx** â†’ Nuxt DevTools-style card layout
   - Centered floating card design instead of full-width bottom panel
   - Glass morphism effect with backdrop-blur and transparency
   - Maintained shadcn sidebar for plugin navigation
   - Responsive dimensions with mobile-friendly constraints

2. **DevToolReducedBar.tsx** â†’ Laravel Debugbar-style horizontal bar
   - Horizontal plugin tabs replacing vertical sidebar approach
   - Status indicators with colored dots for plugin states
   - Full-width bottom positioning for maximum plugin visibility
   - Laravel-inspired styling with modern shadcn components

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Expanded Mode:** Premium card experience for deep exploration (Nuxt DevTools)
- **Reduced Mode:** Quick access horizontal bar for monitoring (Laravel Debugbar)
- **Consistency:** Maintained shadcn UI components and design tokens throughout

### Plugin Architecture (Previous)
- Implemented flexible plugin system with lifecycle hooks
- Added plugin installation and management capabilities
- Created ORPC client integration for type-safe API communication

### Core Plugins (Stable)
- Bundle plugin for webpack analysis
- Routes plugin for Next.js route inspection
- CLI plugin for command execution
- Logs plugin for application monitoring

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: UI Polish & Testing
- Verify new UI design across different screen sizes
- Test transition animations between modes
- Ensure accessibility compliance with new layouts

### Priority 2: Plugin Ecosystem Enhancement
- Complete auth plugin implementation with new UI patterns
- Enhance todo plugin with full CRUD operations leveraging card layout
- Add more visualization to bundle plugin using expanded space

### Priority 3: Documentation & Developer Experience
- Update plugin development guide with new UI patterns
- Create examples showing card vs horizontal layouts
- Implement plugin discovery mechanism

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### UI Architecture Decisions
**Card vs Full-Screen:** Chose card approach for expanded mode to maintain application context visibility while providing substantial devtool space.

**Horizontal vs Vertical:** Selected horizontal layout for reduced mode to maximize plugin visibility and match Laravel Debugbar familiarity.

**Shadcn Integration:** Maintained shadcn sidebar components even in card layout for consistency and component reuse.

### Technical Considerations
**TypeScript Strictness:** Maintaining zero-any policy across new UI components
**Performance:** Card layout reduces DOM impact compared to full overlay
**Responsive Design:** Card approach scales better across device sizes

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### UI Design Patterns
- **Card-First Design:** Expanded mode uses floating card with glass morphism
- **Horizontal Navigation:** Reduced mode prioritizes horizontal plugin access
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between modes without jarring transitions
- **Modern Aesthetics:** Backdrop blur, rounded corners, subtle shadows

### Component Architecture
- **Shadcn Sidebar:** Maintained for expanded mode navigation
- **Flexible Layout:** Components adapt to card vs full-width constraints
- **Status Indicators:** Consistent visual language across both modes
- **Responsive Sizing:** Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements

### Development Preferences
- **Mixed Design Language:** Combining best practices from multiple devtools
- **User-Centered Design:** Mode switching based on task requirements
- **Performance Awareness:** Lightweight implementations for reduced mode
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation and screen reader support maintained
