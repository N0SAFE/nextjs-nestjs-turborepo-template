description: Shared contracts, implementations, and generated clients.
order: 6
---

From `docs/ORPC-TYPE-CONTRACTS.md`.

- Contracts in `packages/api-contracts`
- Implement in `apps/api` with NestJS
- Generate clients/hooks: `bun run web -- generate`
- Usage: `api.users.getProfile.useQuery()` and `orpcClient.users.getProfile()`

Benefits: compile-time safety, autocompletion, easy refactors.
