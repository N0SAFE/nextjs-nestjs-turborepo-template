## Frontend

- Next.js 16.x (App Router)
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS + shared UI package (`@repo/ui`)
- TanStack Query for client cache orchestration

## Backend

- NestJS 11
- ORPC 1.13.x (contracts + transport + integration)
- Better Auth 1.4.x
- Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL

## Tooling and platform

- Bun workspaces + Turborepo task orchestration
- Docker Compose for local and production-like stacks
- Vitest for testing
- ESLint/TypeScript shared configs via internal packages

## Why this stack

1. **Type continuity** from contracts to UI hooks.
2. **Fast local iteration** with Bun + Turbo + Docker.
3. **Clear boundary model** between shared packages and app implementations.
4. **Scalable deployment model** with separate API/web containers.
