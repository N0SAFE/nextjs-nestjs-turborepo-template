## Environment modes

- **Dev**: fast feedback, mounted sources, watch mode.
- **Prod-like**: closer to production constraints for verification.
- **Prod**: minimal runtime footprint and stricter startup behavior.

## Build principles

1. Keep layers deterministic and cache-friendly.
2. Separate dependency installation from app copy where possible.
3. Minimize final image runtime surface.
4. Keep environment handling explicit and reproducible.

## Common commands

```bash
bun run dev
bun run prod
bun run docker:build
```

## Troubleshooting focus

- Cache invalidation issues between image layers
- Environment mismatch between host and container
- Resource constraints (memory/CPU) causing build instability

<DocCallout title="Operational tip" tone="warning">
Treat Docker Compose files as environment contracts: changing service names/ports without synchronized docs and env updates causes cascading runtime failures.
