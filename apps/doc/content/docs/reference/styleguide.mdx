## Code style expectations

- Use shared lint and formatting configs from internal config packages.
- Prefer explicit typing at public boundaries.
- Keep feature logic in domain/service layers, not mixed into UI scaffolding.

## Documentation style expectations

- Keep docs task-oriented and verifiable.
- Prefer linking over duplicating long explanations.
- Update related docs when behavior or commands change.

## Commit style

- Use conventional commit prefixes with meaningful scopes.
- Keep changes focused and coherent per commit.
