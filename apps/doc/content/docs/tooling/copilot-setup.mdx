## Goals

- Keep AI assistance aligned with repository architecture and patterns.
- Reduce repeated context loading through clear documentation entry points.
- Enforce practical constraints for safer code edits.

## Baseline expectations

- Follow repository AGENTS instructions and local scope overrides.
- Prefer existing contracts/patterns over introducing ad-hoc designs.
- Update documentation in the same PR for behavior changes.

## Good usage pattern

1. Read relevant docs before implementing.
2. Confirm existing patterns in target scope.
3. Make small verifiable changes.
4. Run checks and summarize outcomes.
