# Authentication (Better Auth)

Authentication uses Better Auth across API and Web.

## Key points

- Session management via Better Auth
- Server components can read session with a helper
- Roles/permissions enforced by NestJS guards

## Where to look

- API config in apps/api (auth module/config)
- Web integration helpers in apps/web

## Common flows

- Check session in Next.js server component
- Protect API routes with guards
- Configure providers/secrets via environment
