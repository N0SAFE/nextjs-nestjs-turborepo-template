# Project Setup Summary

## What Was Done

This task analyzed the repository to identify unimplemented features and created resources to help you set up a GitHub Project for tracking them.

## Files Created

### 1. Feature Roadmap
**Location**: `.docs/planning/FEATURE-ROADMAP.md`

A comprehensive document tracking 100+ features organized by:
- **Categories**: MCP, API, Frontend, Testing, DevOps, Documentation, Developer Experience
- **Priorities**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Phases**: Phase 1-4 implementation timeline
- **Details**: Benefits, tasks, acceptance criteria for each feature

### 2. Project Setup Guide
**Location**: `scripts/generate-project-tasks.md`

A detailed guide covering:
- Manual GitHub Project setup steps
- Automated issue creation with GitHub CLI
- CSV import options
- Post-setup configuration
- Project maintenance guidelines

### 3. Issue Creation Script
**Location**: `scripts/create-roadmap-issues.sh`

An executable shell script that:
- Creates all necessary labels
- Generates Phase 1 (Critical) issues

## Next Steps

### For Repository Owners

#### Option 1: Manual Setup (Recommended for Control)
1. Go to GitHub repository â†’ Projects tab
2. Create new Project: "Feature Development Roadmap"
3. Follow `scripts/generate-project-tasks.md` for detailed setup
4. Create issues manually using templates from Feature Roadmap

#### Option 2: Semi-Automated Setup (Recommended for Speed)
1. Run the label creation part of the script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create-roadmap-issues.sh --dry-run  # Preview first
   ./scripts/create-roadmap-issues.sh            # Create Phase 1 issues
   ```
2. Create GitHub Project manually via web UI
3. Add created issues to project
4. Configure project views and automation

#### Option 3: Fully Manual (Best for Customization)
1. Read `.docs/planning/FEATURE-ROADMAP.md` thoroughly
2. Create GitHub Project
3. Prioritize which features to implement first
4. Create issues for selected features
5. Organize by milestone/phase

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review the Feature Roadmap**
   - Read `.docs/planning/FEATURE-ROADMAP.md`
   - Identify which features align with your goals
   - Adjust priorities as needed

2. **Create GitHub Project**
   - Follow `scripts/generate-project-tasks.md`
   - Set up columns: Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Done
   - Add custom fields: Priority, Category, Effort, Phase

3. **Populate with Phase 1 Features**
   - Use the script or create manually
   - Focus on 10 critical foundation features
   - These are marked as "Priority: Critical"

4. **Configure Project Automation**
   - Auto-add new issues to project
   - Auto-move to "In Progress" when PR linked
   - Auto-move to "Done" when PR merged

5. **Start Development**
   - Pick a Phase 1 feature
   - Implement following the tasks in the issue
   - Submit PR and link to issue
   - Track progress in project

## Feature Implementation Phases

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Implement Phase 1 features first
2. **Stay Focused**: Don't try to implement everything at once
3. **Document as You Go**: Update docs when implementing features
4. **Test Early**: Add tests alongside feature implementation
5. **Review Regularly**: Update roadmap and project monthly
6. **Seek Feedback**: Get user feedback on implemented features
7. **Iterate**: Improve based on what you learn

## Maintenance

### Weekly
- Review project board
- Update issue statuses
- Prioritize next week's work

### Monthly
- Review feature roadmap
- Adjust priorities based on learnings
- Plan next phase
- Update documentation

### Quarterly
- Major roadmap review
