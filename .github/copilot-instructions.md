# AI Coding Agent Instructions

This Next.js + NestJS turborepo uses modern patterns and conventions that require specific knowledge for effective development.

## Architecture Overview

**Monorepo Structure**: Turborepo with apps (`web/`, `api/`) and shared packages (`ui/`, `api-contracts/`, etc.)
- Frontend: Next.js 15.4 with App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- Backend: NestJS with ORPC, Drizzle ORM, Better Auth, PostgreSQL
- Type Safety: End-to-end with shared contracts and declarative routing

## Critical Development Patterns

### 1. Docker-First Development
**Always use Docker commands for development:**
```bash
bun run dev              # Full stack (API + Web + DB + Redis)
bun run dev:api          # API only with database
bun run dev:web          # Web only (requires running API)
```
Never run `next dev` or `nest start` directly - services are containerized with proper networking.

### 2. Declarative Routing System
**Routes are type-safe and generated**, not manually written:
- Route definitions: `apps/web/src/app/**/page.info.ts`
- Generate routes: `bun run web -- dr:build` (required after route changes)
- Usage: `import { Home, ApiAuth } from '@/routes'` then `<Home.Link>` or `ApiAuth.fetch()`
- **Never** use raw `href` strings or manual `fetch()` calls

### 3. API Contracts with ORPC
**Shared type-safe contracts between frontend/backend:**
- Contracts: `packages/api-contracts/index.ts`
- API implementation: `apps/api/src/` using ORPC decorators
- Client usage: Generated hooks via `@orpc/tanstack-query`
- Changes require rebuilding web app: `bun run web -- generate`

### 4. Shared Package System
**Internal packages use workspace references:**
```json
"@repo/ui": "*"           // Not published packages
"@repo/api-contracts": "*" // Shared between apps
```
Import like: `import { Button } from '@repo/ui'`

### 5. Environment Configuration
**Multi-environment setup with Docker:**
- Development: `.env` file with Docker service URLs
- API URL patterns: `http://api:3001` (internal) vs `http://localhost:3001` (external)
- Use `envcli` for environment variable interpolation in scripts

## Key Commands & Workflows

### Development
```bash
bun run dev                    # Start full development stack
bun run web -- dr:build:watch # Watch mode for route generation
bun run api -- db:studio      # Database admin UI
```

### Building & Testing
```bash
bun run build                  # Build all apps and packages
bun run test                   # Run all tests
bun run test:coverage          # Coverage across monorepo
```

### Database Operations
```bash
bun run api -- db:generate    # Generate migrations
bun run api -- db:push        # Push schema changes
bun run api -- db:migrate     # Run migrations
bun run api -- db:seed        # Seed development data
```

## File Organization Patterns

### Next.js App (apps/web/)
- **App Router**: `src/app/*/page.tsx` with co-located `page.info.ts`
- **Components**: `src/components/` for app-specific, `packages/ui/` for shared
- **State**: Zustand stores in `src/state/`
- **API Client**: Generated ORPC hooks in `src/lib/api.ts`

### NestJS API (apps/api/)
- **Modules**: Feature-based modules with ORPC contracts
- **Database**: Drizzle schema in `src/db/drizzle/schema/`
- **Auth**: Better Auth configuration in `src/auth.ts`

### Shared Packages
- **UI**: Shadcn components with Tailwind in `packages/ui/`
- **Contracts**: ORPC procedures in `packages/api-contracts/`
- **Config**: Shared ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind configs

## Common Gotchas

1. **Route Changes**: Always run `bun run web -- dr:build` after modifying route structure
2. **Docker Networking**: Use container names (`api:3001`) for server-side, localhost for client-side
3. **Type Generation**: API contract changes require `bun run web -- generate`
4. **Hot Reloading**: Files are mounted in Docker - changes should reflect immediately
5. **Database**: PostgreSQL runs in Docker - connection strings use container networking

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest with coverage thresholds (75%)
- **Integration**: ORPC contracts ensure API compatibility
- **E2E**: Via declarative routes for type-safe navigation

## Debugging Tips

```bash
bun run dev:api:logs          # View API container logs
bun run dev:web:logs          # View web container logs
docker exec -it [container] sh # Shell into containers
```

When making changes, follow this order: API contracts ‚Üí API implementation ‚Üí route generation ‚Üí frontend implementation.

## Documentation Maintenance

**IMPORTANT**: As an AI coding agent, you have a responsibility to keep documentation accurate and up-to-date. 

### When to Update Documentation

Update relevant documentation whenever you:

1. **Add/Modify API Endpoints**: Update `docs/ORPC-TYPE-CONTRACTS.md` and `docs/DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md`
2. **Change Environment Variables**: Update `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`, `docs/ENVIRONMENT-TEMPLATE-SYSTEM.md`, and relevant deployment docs
3. **Modify Docker Configuration**: Update `docs/DOCKER-BUILD-STRATEGIES.md` and deployment guides
4. **Update Dependencies**: Update `docs/TECH-STACK.md` with new versions and rationale
5. **Change Database Schema**: Update `docs/DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md` database sections
6. **Add/Remove Routes**: Update `apps/web/src/routes/README.md` and routing documentation
7. **Modify Authentication Flow**: Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and setup guides
8. **Change Testing Setup**: Update `docs/TESTING.md` and testing documentation
9. **Alter Deployment Procedures**: Update production and platform-specific deployment guides
10. **Add New Features**: Create or update relevant documentation sections

### Documentation Update Process

1. **Identify Impact**: Determine which documentation files are affected by your changes
2. **Update Content**: Modify the documentation to reflect new reality
3. **Verify Accuracy**: Ensure examples, commands, and procedures are correct
4. **Check Cross-References**: Update any links or references in other documentation files
5. **Test Instructions**: Verify that documented procedures actually work

### Documentation Quality Standards

- **Be Specific**: Include exact commands, file paths, and code examples
- **Stay Current**: Remove deprecated information and update version numbers
- **Cross-Reference**: Link related documentation sections appropriately
- **Include Context**: Explain not just what to do, but why and when
- **Test Examples**: Ensure all code examples and commands actually work

**Remember**: Documentation is code. Treat it with the same care and attention as you would application code. Outdated documentation can be worse than no documentation at all.
