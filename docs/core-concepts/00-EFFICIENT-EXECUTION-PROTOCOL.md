# Efficient Execution Protocol

> **Type**: Core Concept - Communication & Workflow  
> **Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-10-14

## Overview

This protocol defines how AI assistants should communicate and execute tasks in this project. The focus is on **action-oriented execution** with minimal unnecessary explanation.

## Core Principles

### 1. Silent Context Gathering
Read all necessary files **WITHOUT announcing** what you're reading.

**‚ùå WRONG:**
```
I'll first read the service file to understand the implementation...
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
```
[Silently reads all required files]
[Executes task]
```

### 2. Batch File Operations
Read or write multiple files **simultaneously**, never sequentially announce each read.

### 3. Immediate Implementation
After gathering context, implement directly without verbose explanations.

### 4. Explain Only Critical Steps
Only explain decisions that significantly impact:
- Architecture
- Security
- Data integrity

**Example of when to explain:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Security concern: This endpoint bypasses authentication. 
Implementing AuthGuard on controller.

[Shows implementation]
```

### 5. Concise User Requests
When context is missing, **batch all questions** into a single, minimal request.

**‚ùå BAD (Multiple Questions):**
- "What authentication method should I use?"
- *[waits for response]*
- "Should I use JWT or session-based auth?"
- *[waits for response]*

**‚úÖ GOOD (Single Batched Request):**
```
Missing context:
1. Auth method: JWT/session?
2. Token storage location?
3. Session duration?
```

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå **NEVER say**: "I'll read the file X to understand Y"
‚ùå **NEVER say**: "Let me check the documentation first"
‚ùå **NEVER say**: "I'm going to create/modify file X now"
‚ùå **NEVER explain**: Simple CRUD operations, basic refactoring, or standard pattern implementations
‚ùå **NEVER announce**: Tool usage or file operations unless critical

## What TO Do

‚úÖ **Read files silently**: Gather all context needed without commentary
‚úÖ **Implement immediately**: After reading, execute the task directly
‚úÖ **Explain critical choices**: Only when architectural decisions, security implications, or data integrity is at stake
‚úÖ **Batch questions**: If context is missing, ask all questions at once in minimal form
‚úÖ **Show results**: Present completed work, not the journey to get there

## Communication Style Examples

### Example 1: Creating a New Service

**BAD (Verbose):**
```
I'll first read the service file to understand the current implementation, 
then I'll read the adapter to see how transformations work, 
and finally I'll check the controller to understand the endpoint structure.
After that, I'll implement the changes you requested.
```

**GOOD (Action-Oriented):**
```
[Silently reads service, adapter, controller files]
[Implements changes]
[Shows completed implementation]
```

### Example 2: Critical Decision

**When explanation IS needed:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Architectural conflict: Request suggests direct database access in controller, 
but Service-Adapter pattern requires service layer. Implementing with service layer.

[Shows implementation]
```

## Enforcement

This protocol is **mandatory** for all AI assistant interactions in this project. Violations result in verbose, inefficient communication that wastes time and context.
