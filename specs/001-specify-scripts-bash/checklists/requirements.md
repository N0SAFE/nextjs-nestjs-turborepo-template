# Specification Quality Checklist: Documentation Structure Reorganization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Checks Pass

This specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Quality Assessment

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| User Story P1 Priority | ✅ Complete | 3 P1 stories: (1) LLM discovery via core-concepts/README.md hub, (2) developer navigation, (3) Copilot → core-concepts/README.md entry point |
| Copilot Instructions Architecture | ✅ Complete | Clarified: copilot-instructions.md points to core-concepts/README.md (single entry point); README.md orchestrates all mandatory reading |
| Core-Concepts Hub Design | ✅ Complete | core-concepts/README.md explains purpose, links to COPILOT-WORKFLOW-DIAGRAM.md, lists all core-concepts with mandatory links |
| Requirements Clarity | ✅ Complete | 10 functional requirements, FR-002 and FR-003 define README.md hub and copilot-instructions.md entry point |
| Success Metrics | ✅ Complete | 10 success criteria, SC-001, SC-002, SC-003 verify hub architecture and single entry point |
| Edge Cases | ✅ Identified | 4 edge cases capture scope boundaries and potential conflicts |
| Assumptions | ✅ Documented | Clear: core-concepts/README.md is governance hub; copilot-instructions.md is thin entry point; COPILOT-WORKFLOW-DIAGRAM.md is required reading |
| Scope Boundaries | ✅ Clear | Feature focuses on documentation reorganization; doesn't include content migration or rendering engine changes |

### Key Strengths

1. **User-Centric**: Stories focus on real personas (LLM agents, developers, Copilot) with concrete value
2. **Measurable**: All success criteria include specific metrics (100%, ≤3 clicks, 90%, zero broken links)
3. **Actionable**: Functional requirements are specific enough to guide planning without prescribing implementation
4. **Scope-Bounded**: Clear distinction between what's included (structure, navigation, categorization) and what's not (rendering, content creation)

### Ready for Planning

This specification provides sufficient detail and clarity for the planning phase. The next step is `/speckit.plan` to:
1. Analyze technical feasibility
2. Identify implementation phases
3. Map requirements to tasks
4. Define delivery increments

---

**Next Action**: Run `/speckit.plan` with this specification to begin implementation planning.
