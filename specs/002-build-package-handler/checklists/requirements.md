# Specification Quality Checklist: Build package handler

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

All checklist items were reviewed against the spec at `../spec.md` (2025-10-23). The spec contains:

- Clear user stories with acceptance scenarios (Developer, CI, Tooling)
- Functional and non-functional requirements (FR-001..FR-010, NFR-001..NFR-003)
- Success criteria that are measurable and verifiable (SC-001..SC-005)
- Edge cases and assumptions documented
- Core Concepts compliance section referencing ORPC, Service-Adapter, AuthService, and Documentation Maintenance

No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were found. The spec deliberately avoids implementation language choices and leaves extensibility hooks for artifact storage and remote caching.

## Notes

- If you want stronger technology-agnostic wording for the NFR timing targets, consider moving the numeric targets from NFR into Success Criteria as optional benchmarks.
- Otherwise the specification is ready for planning and implementation scaffolding.

Items marked incomplete previously have been resolved. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` or implementation scaffolding.
