# Clarification Session Report: Eject and Customize System

**Session Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Feature**: Eject and Customize System for Monorepo Template  
**Branch**: `002-eject-and-customize`  
**Status**: ✅ **CLARIFICATIONS COMPLETE** - Ready for Phase 2 Implementation  

---

## Executive Summary

Three critical ambiguities were identified and resolved through structured questioning. All answers have been integrated into `spec.md`. No blocking issues remain for Phase 2 implementation.

**Clarification Score**: 3/3 questions asked and resolved (all quota used productively)

---

## Clarifications Completed

### Q1: User Roles and Personas ✅ RESOLVED

**Question**: Should the system support multiple user personas (Developer, Maintainer, Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), or focus on a single user archetype?

**Answer Selected**: **Option A** - Single "Developer" archetype

**Clarification Details**:
- **Primary User**: Developer who forks the template, removes showcase, and customizes for their specific needs
- **Scope**: No separate Maintainer UI, no skill-level branching (Beginner/Advanced paths)
- **Justification**: Aligns with original feature request (single developer use case), simplifies UX, easier to validate with "Independent test" criterion
- **Impact on Implementation**: 
  - ✅ Simplifies prompt design (no conditional branching based on skill level)
  - ✅ Reduces testing matrix (one primary flow, not multiple paths)
  - ✅ Clearer error handling (target one user competency level)
- **Spec Updates**: Added to Clarifications section + Assumptions #5

**Acceptance Criteria**: All interactive prompts assume Developer has basic CLI/Git familiarity; no explanatory onboarding needed

---

### Q2: Recovery Mechanism on Failure ✅ RESOLVED

**Question**: When eject/customize fails mid-way, should recovery be manual (user runs `--rollback`), automatic with prompt, automatic silent, or snapshot-based?

**Answer Selected**: **Options B+D Hybrid** - Snapshot-primary with prompted recovery options

**Clarification Details**:
- **Pre-Operation Backup**: System creates `.backup/` snapshots BEFORE starting eject/customize
- **Failure Detection**: System monitors exit codes and validates state after each phase
- **User Prompt on Failure**: Displays three options:
  1. "Rollback and retry?" (restore from `.backup/`, re-run operation)
  2. "Rollback and abort?" (restore from `.backup/`, stop)
  3. "Continue anyway?" (proceed despite errors - risky)
- **Recovery Execution**: Rollback restores from `.backup/` system (faster than Git for large operations)
- **Performance**: Meets SC-006 (<1 min recovery) since snapshot restore is O(n) copy vs. Git reset complexity
- **Safety**: User retains control (prompt) + system automates recovery (non-destructive)
- **Impact on Implementation**:
  - ✅ Requires `.backup/` directory infrastructure
  - ✅ Failure detection logic in each phase
  - ✅ User prompt handling (interactive CLI input)
  - ✅ Snapshot restore procedure (file operations)
- **Spec Updates**: Added to Clarifications + FR-015, FR-016, FR-017 + Assumptions #9

**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- Snapshot created before operation starts
- Failure triggers prompt within 2 seconds
- Rollback restores fully in <60 seconds
- User can retry after rollback

---

### Q3: Error Communication and Progress UX ✅ RESOLVED

**Question**: How should the system communicate progress during long operations (SC-001: <2 min eject) and communicate errors to support independent task completion (SC-005: 80% first-try)?

**Answer Selected**: **Option A** - Real-time progress bars + structured error messages

**Clarification Details**:
- **Progress Display**: Real-time progress bars for each operation phase:
  - Phase 1: "Analyzing manifests..." [████░░░░░░] 40%
  - Phase 2: "Removing files..." [██████████] 100%
  - Phase 3: "Validating project..." [████████░░] 80%
- **Error Message Structure**: On failure, display:
  1. **What failed**: Specific error (e.g., "Failed to remove file: src/pages/showcase.tsx")
  2. **Why it failed**: Root cause (e.g., "File in use by process, permission denied")
  3. **Suggested action**: Auto-generated recovery suggestion (e.g., "Close IDE, then retry")
- **Verbosity**: Structured, not verbose - shows actionable info, hides low-level details
- **Logging**: Also writes to `.eject-logs/latest-operation.json` for detailed auditing
- **Impact on Implementation**:
  - ✅ Requires progress bar library (cli-progress, listr2, ora, etc.)
  - ✅ Structured error enum with messages and recovery suggestions
  - ✅ Phase detection and granular error handling
  - ✅ File logging infrastructure in `.eject-logs/`
- **Spec Updates**: Added to Clarifications + FR-013, FR-014 + Assumptions #10

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Progress bars update every 200-500ms
- Error messages fit in terminal width (80 chars)
- User can see progress without reading logs
- Error messages enable independent recovery without documentation lookup
- Supports SC-005: 80% of developers successfully complete eject without external help

## Impact on Phase 2 Tasks

These clarifications affect Phase 2 implementation planning in three areas:

### Task Decomposition Changes
1. **Infrastructure** (newly specified via Q2):
   - Add `.backup/` directory management module
   - Add failure detection and state validation logic
   - Add snapshot creation/restore procedures

2. **CLI/UX** (newly specified via Q3):
   - Add progress bar integration (per-phase tracking)
   - Add structured error message system with recovery suggestions
   - Add `.eject-logs/` directory for audit trail

3. **Recovery Workflows** (newly specified via Q2):
   - Implement failure detection after each phase
   - Implement user prompt with three options
   - Implement rollback-to-checkpoint flow

### Success Criteria Coverage
- **SC-001** (<2 min eject): Progress bars prevent user anxiety during long operations
- **SC-005** (80% independent task completion): Structured error messages + recovery suggestions enable self-service recovery
- **SC-006** (<1 min rollback): Snapshot restoration achieves sub-60-second recovery

### Test Cases to Add
- Q2: Snapshot creation, failure detection, prompt display, rollback execution
- Q3: Progress bar rendering, error message formatting, recovery suggestion accuracy

**Generated**: 2025-10-16  
**Next Phase**: `/speckit.tasks` for Phase 2 task breakdown
**Category**: Non-Functional Quality Attributes (Reliability)  
**Impact**: HIGH - Directly affects SC-006 (<1 min rollback) and SC-002 (95% first-try success)  
**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM - Process mentioned but user experience unclear

**Question**: When eject/customize fails mid-way, how should the system handle recovery?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | **Manual Recovery**: User must run explicit `bun run eject --rollback` or `git reset --hard`. Requires Git knowledge. |
| **B+D (Selected)** | **Auto-recovery with choice**: Detect failure → create `.backup/` snapshots → prompt user (Rollback+retry / Rollback+abort / Continue anyway?) → execute via snapshot. Hybrid approach. |
| C | **Silent Auto-Rollback**: System detects failure, silently restores via Git checkpoint. No user prompt. Maximum automation. |
| D | **Backup Snapshots**: Create full `.backup/` copy before operations. Restore from snapshot on failure. |

**Decision**: **Hybrid Option B+D (User-Prompted, Snapshot-Based)**

**Clarification**: System creates backup snapshots in `.backup/` directory before operations AND prompts user on failure with three recovery choices.

**Rationale**: 
- Balances automation (user doesn't run Git commands) with transparency (prompt informs user)
- Snapshot-based recovery faster and more reliable than Git operations
- User agency via prompt supports SC-005 (80% independent task completion)
- Meets SC-006 (<1 min rollback) since snapshot restore is fast
- Handles edge cases (no Git, uncommitted changes) better than pure Git approach

**Integration**: 
- Added to Functional Requirements (FR-014, FR-015): Recovery prompts and snapshot mechanism
- Added to Assumptions section (A-10): "Automatic Recovery with Choice"
- Documented in Phase 1 data model (EjectConfiguration entity tracks backup location)

**Impact on Implementation**:
- Requires `.backup/` directory management
- Need prompt/choice UX component
- Snapshot creation before every eject/customize
- Automatic vs. manual Git comparison removed from scope
- Storage of multiple backup snapshots (clean up old ones?)

---

### Question 3: Error Communication and Progress UX
**Category**: Interaction & UX Flow  
**Impact**: HIGH - Directly affects SC-005 (80% independent task completion) and user experience of long-running operations  
**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM - "Detailed logging" mentioned but specifics absent

**Question**: How should the system communicate progress and errors during long-running operations (SC-001: <2 min eject)?

| **A (Selected)** | **Real-time Progress Bars + Structured Errors**: Progress bars per phase (analyze → remove → validate). On error: (1) What failed, (2) Why, (3) Auto-suggested recovery action. Clear but not verbose. |
|---|---|
| B | **Verbose Logging Mode**: Output everything to console + `.eject-logs/` file. User must read logs to understand. Comprehensive but complex. |
| C | **Silent Mode**: Only show success or final error. No progress. Faster perception but opaque. |
| D | **Interactive Troubleshooting**: On error, launch diagnostic wizard asking clarifying questions. Thorough but complex. |

**Decision**: **Option A - Real-time Progress + Structured Errors**

**Rationale**:
- Progress bars reduce user anxiety during 2-minute eject operation
- Structured error format (what/why/suggestion) supports independent task completion (SC-005's 80% target)
- Doesn't require Git/advanced knowledge
- Balances transparency with clarity
- Supports both experienced and less experienced developers

**Integration**:
- Added to Functional Requirements (FR-013, FR-016): Progress bars and structured error messages
- Added to Assumptions section (A-11): "Progress Transparency"

**Impact on Implementation**:
- Requires progress bar library (CLI UX component)
- Error messages must be structured and human-readable
- Need to map internal errors to user-friendly messages + recovery suggestions
- Phases must be clearly defined (analyze, remove, validate) for progress tracking
- Logging to `.eject-logs/` still supported but not primary communication path

---

## Impact on Phase 2 Implementation

### New Implementation Requirements
1. **Progress Bar UX**: CLI library for real-time progress bars (e.g., `cli-progress`, `ink`)
2. **Snapshot System**: Directory management for `.backup/` with timestamp-based versions
3. **Recovery Menu**: Interactive prompt for retry/abort/continue choices (already uses `prompts` library)
4. **Error Structuring**: Map internal errors to user-friendly messages with recovery suggestions
5. **Phase Definition**: Clearly define and report progress for analyze/remove/validate phases

### Removed Complexity
1. ✅ No skill-level branching or separate "Maintainer" UX path
2. ✅ No manual Git recovery commands (user doesn't need to know Git)
3. ✅ No diagnostic wizard (simpler error UX)
4. ✅ No verbose logging as primary path (structured messages instead)

### Data Model Impacts
- EjectConfiguration entity already includes backup_location tracking (from Phase 1) ✅
- OperationLog entity already includes error tracking (from Phase 1) ✅
- Phase tracking (analyze/remove/validate) aligns with existing removal strategy ✅

### Success Criteria Alignment
- **SC-005** (80% independent completion): Supported by structured errors + auto-suggestions
- **SC-006** (<1 min rollback): Supported by snapshot-based recovery
- **SC-001** (<2 min eject): Progress bars help user understand timing expectations
- **SC-002** (95% first-try): Error communication reduces repeat failures
