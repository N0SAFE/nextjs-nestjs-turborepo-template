# Specification Quality Checklist: Eject and Customize System for Monorepo Template

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Feature**: [Eject and Customize System Specification](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - **All resolved**
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarification Resolution

### Resolved: Feature Removal Detection Strategy

**Selected Option**: **B - Manual Manifests**

**Rationale**: Each removable feature has a manually-maintained manifest file listing exactly what should be removed. This approach:
- Provides maximum reliability and predictability
- Makes testing straightforward and comprehensive
- Eliminates risk of missing edge cases
- Allows for feature-specific cleanup logic
- Scales well as new features are added to the template

**Implementation Implication**: FR-004 updated to require manifest-based removal strategy

## Notes

- The specification is comprehensive with 4 well-prioritized user stories
- All edge cases are thoughtfully identified
- Success criteria are specific and measurable
- All clarifications have been resolved with explicit decision documented
- Manual manifests provide clear, testable, and maintainable removal strategy

## Status

**Ready for Planning Phase**: YES âœ… - Proceed to `/speckit.plan` for architecture and implementation planning.
