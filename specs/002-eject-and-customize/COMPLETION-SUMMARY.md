**Report**: `CLARIFICATION-REPORT.md`

**Results**:
- Questions asked: 3
- Questions answered: 3
- Resolution rate: 100%
- Ambiguities eliminated: 3

**Q1-Q3 Decisions Integrated**:
- Q1: Single Developer archetype → Eliminates maintainer UI complexity

**Outstanding Ambiguities After Session 1**: 0

---

### ✅ Phase 1: Implementation Plan (Complete)

**File**: `plan.md` (250+ lines)

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Tech stack documented (TypeScript 5.x, Node.js 20+, Bun 1.2.14+)
- ✅ Project structure defined (packages/eject-customize/ as main)
- ✅ Implementation approach detailed (3-phase removal strategy)
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies
- ✅ Timeline estimates per phase
- ✅ Dependencies and blockers identified

**Key Decisions**:
- JSON manifests for feature definitions
- Three-phase workflow: analyze → remove → validate
- Git-based recovery as secondary mechanism
- Prompts library for interactive selection
- Two-tier validation (syntax + runtime)

---

### ✅ Phase 1.2: Data Model (Complete)

**File**: `data-model.md` (150+ lines)

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ 5 entity types defined with TypeScript interfaces
  - FeatureManifest
  - EjectConfiguration
  - CustomModule
  - FrameworkSwap
  - OperationLog
- ✅ Relationships between entities
- ✅ Validation rules per entity
- ✅ Field descriptions and constraints

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Manifests stored as JSON for portability
- Configuration saves user selections for resume capability
- Logs track all operations for transparency

---

### ✅ Phase 1.3: Research & Decisions (Complete)

**File**: `research.md` (200+ lines)

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ 10 research tasks completed with decisions
- ✅ Rationale documented for each decision
- ✅ Trade-offs analyzed
- ✅ Alternatives considered and rejected with reasons

**Key Research Findings**:
1. JSON manifests (chosen over YAML) - better ecosystem support
2. Three-phase removal process - max safety
3. Git-based recovery (chosen over DB) - simplicity
4. Prompts library - best interactive CLI
5. Dependency analysis - necessary for prevent-deselection (Q1 Session 2)
6. Two-tier validation - TypeScript + runtime checks
7. Module registry - enable customize command
8. Doc auto-update - dynamic generation from project state
9. Framework swaps - predefined templates (not arbitrary)
10. Docker validation - verify containerization still works

---

### ✅ Phase 1.4: API Contracts (Complete)

**Directory**: `contracts/` (3 files)

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ `eject-manifest-schema.json` - JSON Schema for feature manifests
- ✅ `customize-module-registry-schema.json` - JSON Schema for module registry
- ✅ `feature-registry.example.json` - Example of complete feature registry

**Key Design Artifacts**:
- Manifests define: name, dependencies, files, configs to remove
- Module registry defines: modules available for customize
- Example shows real usage patterns

---

### ✅ Phase 1.5: Clarification Session 2 (Complete)

**Report**: `CLARIFICATION-REPORT-SESSION-2.md`

**Results**:
- Questions asked: 2
- Questions answered: 2
- Resolution rate: 100%
- Ambiguities eliminated: 2

**Q1-Q2 Decisions Integrated**:
- Q1: Prevent deselection (not auto-deselect) for interdependent features
  - Prevents accidental broken states
  - Forces explicit user choices
  - More predictable UX
- Q2: Hybrid error format (prose + JSON logging)
  - Terminal: Human-friendly error messages
  - `.logs/errors.json`: Structured data for debugging
  - Supports both UX and operational transparency

**Outstanding Ambiguities After Session 2**: 0

**Non-blocking Findings**: 4 (can resolve during implementation)

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Task Breakdown (Complete)

**File**: `tasks.md` (1,000+ lines)

**Deliverables**:
